### CLA

  For CLA, I try to manipulate the outcomes from the previous analysis model, and from the perspective of goverments, which have the power to justify the trend. 
  Also, you may confused why not business man? 
  Well, there's a relationship between economic and politic, and people usually exchange their amounts and previleges, which is smiliar to a transaction.
  In this case, it show us that the policy was still mainly lead by the goverments.
  So, to deal with the growing world population, we took just one country as example.
  Such as the goverment of India, which is one of the union goverment system in the world. 
  From their point of view, the greater population desity of the level of country is still a serious problem with huge nembers of population.
  So after provided the related policy, such as birth control policy, it is a must to keep observing to realize how well it works? and the reflections of citizens.
  However, according to the section one which had mention that it hard to make change or justify within a single solution, which may deal with limited domains of issue.
