### CLA

  For CLA, I try to manipulate the outcomes from the previous analysis model, and from the perspective of goverments, which have the power to justify the trend. 
  Also, you may confused why not business man? 
  Well, there's a relationship between economic and politic, and people usually exchange their amounts and previleges, which is smiliar to a transaction.
  In this case, it show us that the policy was still mainly lead by the goverments.
  So, to deal with the growing world population, we took just one country as example.
  Such as the goverment of India, which is one of the union goverment system in the world. 
  From their point of view, the greater population desity of the level of country is still a serious problem with huge nembers of population.
  So after provided the related policy, such as birth control policy, it is a must to keep observing to realize how well it works? and the reflections of citizens.
  However, according to the section one which had mention that it hard to make change or justify within a single solution, which may only deal with limited domains of issue and perhaps cause other problems.
  On the other hand, to maintain and upgrade the policies, they needs taxes, human resourses to keep going however some of them may not be affordable in the long term.
  To reduce cost, the goverment would like to working on the educations of family planning.
  The purpose also includes let people to rise their awareness of the future status which also related to their daily life, not only just thinking the next generations because for ordinary person who would like to consider the surrending things.
  Therefore, people will change their attitudes which mainly affect their movements.
  The similiar successful case is the Special garbage bags used by people in Taiwan. At present, although only in Taipei City and New Taipei City, there are strict regulations that residents must cooperate with the regulations. 
  These garbage bags use materials that are easier to decompose and less polluting to the environment. 
  However, compared with the products in mass merchandise stores on the market, the garbage bags called by the government are more expensive. 
  The purpose is to make people realize that the garbage disposal performed by the cleaning staff is not free. 
  If people want to save money, they must reduce the amount of garbage and implement separate recycling. 
  This policy has been launched for more than ten years, and we can observe that compared with other counties and cities in Taiwan, residents of Taipei City and New Taipei City have a higher awareness of garbage classification and environmental protection. 
  In fact, this policy actually reduces the total cost. Although the production of garbage bags is an expense, due to the reduction of the total amount of garbage, the wages of the cleaning staff, the usage fees and fuel consumption required for the incineration of these garbage are greatly reduced.
